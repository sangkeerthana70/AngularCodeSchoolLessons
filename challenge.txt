Level-2
Using Filters.
In the previous challenge we practiced displaying the prices of 
gems in our index.html. The first gem, Azurite, now costs $110.50 
(due to supply shortages) but our current code doesn't display
the price correctly.
<em class="pull-right">{{product.price| currency}}</em>

Displaying the First Image

We've added images to all products as well â€“ like any self 
respecting store should have. A product has an array of images
we can use in our HTML. Let's get the first image to show on
the page!
<img ng-src="{{product.images[0]}}" />

Display All Thumbnails 140 PTS
Our 2-dimensional clients have worked hard to produce multiple
images for their gems. Display all the thumbnails inside our
gallery without repeating yourself by using an AngularJS directive
on the li.thumbnail element.

task 1/2
Make the li's repeat for each image in the image array. Use 
the variable image as your identifier.
<li class="small-image pull-left thumbnail" ng-repeat="image in product.images">
  <img ng-src="{{image}}" />
</li>
